There are a lot of ways to create and secure your Kubernetes environments from unauthorized access, data breaches and other attackers. I am listing some of the keys ones below:

a. Network Policies - these act as a firewall for pod to pod communicatoon, thus allowing you to control traffic flow betwern pods and network endpoints.
b. RBAC - role based access controls - this allows Kubernetes admins to dynamically configure access policies based on least privilege best practices.
c. Pod security policies - these help defind a set of conditions that pods must meet to be accepted into the pool. These allows k8s admins to enforce security best practices across the cluster.
