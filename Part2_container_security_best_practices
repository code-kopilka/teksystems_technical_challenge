Docker Security Best Practices

List and explain five Docker security best practices:

-- Always use trusted base images, e.g. official and verified images. 
   This helps you to ensuure you are starting with a secure foundation.
   Regularly update these base images to get the latest security patches and updates.

-- Scan docker iamges for vulnerabilities. 
  Build a image building pipeline using Packer that uses a trusted image from official
  sources, scans for vulnerabilities, implements patches, installs all your tools and fixes critical vulnerabilities before deploying.

-- Run docker containers as non-root users. 
   Never run containers with root privileges, instead create a dedicated user in your Dockerfile that
   uses the USER instruction to switch to non-root user.

-- Enable docker content trust. 
   This ensures the integratity and publisher of container images by verifying authenticity of images before pulling and running them.

-- Limit container capabilities and resources. 
   Restrict container privileges and access to the system resources. You could also set resource limits on
   CPU, memory and storage to prevent DDOS attacks.
