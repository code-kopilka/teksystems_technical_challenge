Every incident entails certain procedures like investigation, detection, containment, eradication, communication/reports, and recovery. 
There should be a dedicated Incident Response Team that investigates all incidents.
Once they investigate and establish vulnerability(ies), they come up with plans, procedures, and guidelines to implement.

In this specific case:

-- Identify and investigate the vulnerability
-- Implement immediate threat mitigation measures
-- Work closely with affected parties
-- Determine the root cause of the incident
-- Analyze the extent of the breach
-- Remove the threat from affected systems
-- Repair affected systems and services
-- Communicate the breach to all key stakeholders
-- Conduct thorough lessons learned
-- Create algorithms and set guidelines to prevent recurrence
-- Implement regular testing and maintenance
