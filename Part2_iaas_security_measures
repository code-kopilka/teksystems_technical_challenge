Infrastructure as a Service is a cloud computing model that provudes virtualized computing resources over the internet,
like compute, storage and networking on a pay-as-you-go basis. E.g. AWS, GCP, Azure etc. 

This gives you ability to elastically scale up and down based on your application's needs and demand,
thus eliminating the need for upfront hardware investments and maintenance costs. 

This also gives you flexibility to have more control over your infrastructure than other cloud models.

With IaaS model, you get many benefits as well as unique security challenges. In this model,
you share the responsibility with the provider.

The provider (e.g. AWS) secures the underlying infrastructure, while you are responsible for 
securing your applications, data and access management. 

This division of responsibilities can lead to security gapss if not properly managed and monitored.

To mitigate these risks, organizations should consider strong access control, regular audit and review, robust backup,
encryption of sensitive data and stay up-to-date on latest security threats and vulnerabilities specigic to IaaS environments.
